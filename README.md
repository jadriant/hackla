# ðŸ©º Med GT

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ Med GT is a medical translation tool that streamlines doctor-patient communication. It's meant to facilitate conversation, taking in speech as an input, running it through a medical simplification model, a translation model, and converting the outputs back into text.

## ðŸ§± Structure

This is the main server that communicates between the frontend web client and 4 ML models hosted separately in Huggingface ðŸ¤—

## ðŸ’» Usage

To run this server, fill in `.env.copy` and rename it to `.env`, then simply call

```
python server.py
```

Some informal tests have been setup but without the usual rigour of unit tests, and they can be found under `/test`.
